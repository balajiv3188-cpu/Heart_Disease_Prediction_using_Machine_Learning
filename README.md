# Heart_Disease_Prediction_using_Machine_Learning

# 📌 Project Overview

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early prediction can help doctors take preventive measures.
This project builds multiple machine learning models to predict whether a person is at high risk of heart disease using the Heart 2020 Cleaned dataset.

The project compares several ML algorithms and identifies the best-performing model.
